            <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your PUK code is displayed on the
                SIM
                card holder that came in your starter pack. If you have already registered and have a My Lyca Mobile

            <h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Where can I find my
                        Lyca

            <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In most cases the number will be

            <h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are there any monthly
                        or
                        hidden charges?</strong></span></h3>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lyca Mobile does not believe in
                hidden
                charges. Every price you see on our website is what you’ll pay. </span><br>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How do I contact
                        someone if
                        I have a problem?</strong></span></h3>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt;">For any problems with Lyca Mobile
                services, please visit our Contact us page for alternative ways of contacting us.</span>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How can I stop receiving
                        unwanted texts or spam?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style=" font-size: 10pt;">Unfortunately, Lyca Mobile is
                    unable
                    to prevent you from receiving these unwanted messages, unless you want to ban all text
                    messages.</span>
            </p>
            <h3><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why is there a flashing
                        envelope on my cell?</strong></span></h3>
            <p><span style=" font-size: 10pt;">The flashing envelope indicates
                    your
                    text memory is full. This will usually prevent you from receiving more text messages until you have
                    deleted a few old ones.</span></p>
            <p><span style=" font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How do I make an
                        international call with Lyca Mobile?</strong></span></p>
            <span style="font-size: 10pt;">When it comes to making
                international
                calls, Lyca Mobile works in the same way as other mobiles or landlines. Simply dial the country code you
                are
                calling, then the area code without the first 0 and then the phone number and press the call button.
                Please
                note that most premium voice and text services in other countries cannot be reached from a cell phone
                service when calling from outside that country.</span>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Which mobile handsets
                        can I
                        use with Lyca Mobile?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You can use any handset that is
                    compatible with internationally recognised GSM standards. Today, all major manufacturers follow GSM
                    standards. If you are still unsure about your handset, please call our Customer Service</span></p>

                        you offer?</strong></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lyca Mobile currently only
                    offers
                    Prepaid services and does not have any postpaid plans. However, you can use our auto recharge
                    feature to
                    automate the process of adding credit to your account so that your plan gets renewed every month on

                    tax.
                    However, there may be sales and other taxes (as required by the state) and are charged by the

                    Mobile must collect or that Lyca Mobile must pay as part of regulatory requirements.<br><br></span>
